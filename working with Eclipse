Working with opencv and eclipse is similar to working with any C++ project. The overall outline of steps is as follows:

create the code with eclipse => create CMakeLists.txt and place it outside => create a build directory and call "cmake .."=> call "make" and run the executable.

remember to keep eclipse workspace seperate from project directory.

step 1:

*)Open Eclipse IDE for C/C++ Developers and choose an appropriate location for workspace.
*)File -> New -> C/C++ project.
*)Choose Empty Project under Executable and Linux GCC for toolchains.
*)Create "src" and "include" folder.
*)Place header files with class and function declaration inside "include".
*)Place the function definition in .cpp file and place inside "src" directory.

step 2:

*)Create a "build" folder inside the project directory.
*)Place the CMakeLists.txt file inside the project directory, outside "build" folder.
*)Launch terminal and cd into "build" folder.
*)run "cmake .." commmand. This will generate the makefiles required for the next step.
*)run "make" command now. This will generate the executable file.
*)run the executable with "./executable_name"
